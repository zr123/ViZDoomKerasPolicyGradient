Learning vizdoom with policy gradient

# What this is

A simple implementation of the most common policy gradient algorithms using keras. I tried to keep everything beginner-friendly by usings the frontend API of Keras as much as possible, while keeping the backend-stuff to a minimum. I also tried to keep my code as clean and readable as possible.

# What this isn't

A production-ready or efficient implementation. There is lots of room for optimiziation.
