# Cartpole POC

This a simple implementation of the basic policy gradient algorithm REINFORCE.

Using the sample_weight-parameter to admister the rewards is a simplistic approach taken from:

* https://dirko.github.io/Keras-policy-gradient-2/

Ths is just a simple POC. For a "proper" solution you should write at least custom loss function.
